I'm Frankle and I have almost 4 years of experience working as a Data Scientist. I have worked on a wide range of retail analytics problems in the past few years related mainly to pricing optimization, promotion optimization, coupon redemption propensity analysis, customer churn analysis, and inventory allocation optimization.

I am proficient in technologies like **PostgreSQL**, **BigQuery**, **MySQL**, **Python**, **R**, **PHP**, **Tableau**, and **MS Excel**. I also have some experience in backend development using Python and PHP. I am currently working on an AutoML API for my personal use and also teaching myself Scala and Functional Programming.
